PM-Sage is a lightweight, fully serverless RAG assistant for project managers that preprocesses PDF guides into overlapping, sub-100-token chunks using the AllenAI SciBERT tokenizer before indexing their dense embeddings in FAISS for sub-second similarity search. At runtime, user queries are embedded with Google’s GA text-embedding-005 model via Vertex AI and the GenAI SDK, the top-k chunks are retrieved, and Gemini 2.0 Flash generates concise, citation-grounded answers. The Flask/Functions-Framework Python API on Cloud Functions Gen-2 and React chat UI on Cloud Run deploy in minutes using free-tier resources, with no servers to manage and minimal configuration—all orchestrated through simple CLI scripts for preprocessing, embedding, indexing, and deployment
