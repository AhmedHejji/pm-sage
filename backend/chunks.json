  "many large projects, the project encountered surprises along the way. when a team works on a project where there is little opportunity for interim deliverables or little opportunity for prototyping, the team most likely will use a predictive life cycle to manage it. the team can adapt to what it discovers, but will not be able to use agile approaches to manage the iterative discovery of requirements or incremental deliverables for feedback. the big dig project was not simple by any means. however, many projects that start out",
